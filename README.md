Peer Review Comments: 
Design, concept, & theme is awesome! Game play is smooth and functions well. A small suggestion is to have the different modes end at the max amount of rounds (right now the game does not end unless someone reaches 3 or 4 points for the BEST OF 5 and BEST OF 7 modes and can loop forever if there are constant ties with no winner).
